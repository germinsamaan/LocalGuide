                <p class="p-5 lh-base ">
                    Qaitbay Citadel is one of the most important forts on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The Mamluk
                    sultan al-Ashraf Abu al-Nasr Qaitbay
                    built it between 882 AH/ 1477 AD and 884/ 1479 AD over the ruins of Alexandria's Lighthouse.
                    It served as Alexandria'defence against naval attacks.
                    The citadel was made of limestone and spanned an area of approximately 17550 m2.
                    An outer wall plotted with defence towers surrounds the building.
                    An inner wall surrounds the citadel's courtyard and includes a number of rooms some of them used as
                    barracks and others for storage.
                    The citadel's entrance leads to the courtyard where we find the main tower located in the northwest.
                    It consists of a massive three-floored square fort. Its four corners are occupied by half-circular
                    towers that carry protruding balconies for the defence of the city.
                    A tank near the tower supplied soldiers and their horses with water.
                    Qaitbay citadel drew the attention of rulers throughout the ages, on account of its strategic
                    location.
                    The building was also enlarged and subject to other conservation operations in 2003.

                    The museum is located in a former Italianate mansion. It's the former home of a wood sales person.
                    It used to house the United States consulate. The building dates back to 1926, located around a
                    large garden,
                    in addition to housing a basement. The three-storey palace was a meeting place for the Egyptian
                    upper-class society of Alexandria.
                    The Alexandria National Museum contains around 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria
                    and Egypt.<br />
                    Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum mainly focuses on three
                    collections spread over three floors:<br />
                    Floor 1: Pharaonic epoch. The mummies are shown in a recreation of a funerary chamber.<br />
                    Floor 2: Artifacts from the Hellenistic period and Roman period, including pieces from Heraklion and
                    Canopus.

                    Alexandria City .
                    Alexandria is the second most important city in Egypt after Cairo .
                    Amphitheaters quite spread during the reign of the Romans.
                    They were in different countries like Greece, Italy, and Turkey. They are present in many regions
                    around Europe and the Middle East.
                    Roman Amphitheater Alexandria is the only one of its type in Egypt .
                    The word “Kom El Dekka” in Arabic, means the hill of rubble or the hill of the benches.
                    It named when a famous historian, El Neweiry, passed by this area in the beginning of the 20th
                    century .
                    El Neweiry saw the many piles of rubble and sand. The formed due to the digging of the Mahmoudeyya
                    Canal at the end of the 19th century.
                    The canal linked Alexandria to the Nile River. These piles looked exactly like some huge benches.
                    El Neweiry was the one who gave the area its recent famous name.
                    The Roman Amphitheater Alexandria indeed is one of the most important Roman architectural
                    achievements in Egypt .
                    It was by mere coincidence in 1960. The workers went to remove a pile of dust and sand in 1960.
                    It was to clear the land and construct a governmental building.
                    They found some solid iron columns while digging into the ground.</p>

                <p class="p-5 lh-base">
                    The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is a major library and cultural center on the shore of the Mediterranean
                    Sea in Alexandria, Egypt.
                    It is a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria, once one of the largest libraries worldwide,
                    which was lost in antiquity.
                    The Bibliotheca Alexandrina contains books in classical Arabic, English, and French languages.
                    <br />
                    The idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974 when a committee set up by Alexandria
                    University selected
                    a plot of land for its new library. Construction work began in 1995, and after some US$220 million
                    had been spent,
                    the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002.
                    In 2009, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the Bibliothèque nationale de France
                    (BnF).
                    The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world.<br />

                    The library offers shelf space for eight million books, and its main reading room spans 20,000
                    square meters (220,000 sq ft).
                    The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind
                    and visually impaired,
                    and for children; four museums; four art galleries four temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent
                    exhibitions; a planetarium;
                    and a manuscript restoration laboratory.

                <p class="p-5 lh-base">
                    The museum houses major jewelry pieces and art acquisitions of the dynasty of Muhammad Ali and
                    his descendants, who ruled Egypt for nearly 150 years from 1805 until the 1952 movement.
                    The mother of Princess Fatima had completed the construction of the western wing before her death,
                    when her daughter had reached the age of eighteen.
                    Princess Fatima added an eastern wing to the palace and linked the two wings with a beautiful
                    corridor.
                    The Palace remained in use for summer residence until July 1952. When the princess's property was
                    confiscated,
                    she was allowed to reside in the palace. This was until 1964, when Princess Fatima al-Zahra' "ceded"
                    the palace to the Egyptian
                    government and left for Cairo. Princess Fatima al-Zahra died in 1983. <br />

                    The museum was renovated and developed in 1986 and 1994.
                    Since late 2004, the Supreme Council of Antiquities has begun a comprehensive development and
                    restoration process for
                    the museum at an estimated cost of 10 million Egyptian pounds, with the aim of increasing its
                    capacity to accommodate
                    more valuable exhibits in stores that have not yet been displayed, and the museum was opened in
                    April 2010.
