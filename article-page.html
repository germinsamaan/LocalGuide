        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Citadel of Qaitbay</h2>
        <p class="article-text">The Citadel of Qaitbay is located in Alexandria. And it is not only a monument but a
            wonderful example of historical heritage and architectural beauty.Although from a distance it looks like a
            small sandcastle, the Citadel of Qaitbay is an impressive fortress and has become an important icon of the
            city of Alexandria.Included in almost every tour in Alexandria, a visit to the Citadel of Qaitbay also
            offers tourists dazzling views of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Geographical Location of The citadel of Qaitbay</h2>
        <p class="article-text">The citadel is located at the western end of Alexandria, a strategic location as from
            there it protected the city against attacks from the Crusaders and others, from the 15th century onwards.One
            of its peculiarities is that it was built with the ruins of the ancient lighthouse, which in turn was
            created in the third century AD and was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The lighthouse was almost destroyed during an earthquake that occurred in Egypt in 1303,
            during the reign of the Mameluke Sultan Qalaun.The tour to the citadel of Qaitbay is a recommended tour for
            all tourists visiting the city. There are several trips to Egypt that include the Citadel of Qaitbay the
            half-day or full-day tour to Alexandria.It can be accessed from Corniche (or Costanera) Street, going west.
            It is located at the end of Corniche Street.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">History of The Citadel of Qaitbay</h2>
        <p class="article-text">In June 1477, after celebrating the Prophet Mohammedâ€™s birthday with his people, Sultan
            Qaitbay went to visit Alexandria, accompanied by several nobles, princes, and members of his royal family.
            All of Alexandria was ready for the Sultan and his entourage. Qaitbay explored the place where the ruins of
            the ancient lighthouse were and ordered his men to build a fortified citadel in the same place. Construction
            began in 1477 and was completed in 1479, with Qaitbay officially inaugurating it.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Sultan Qaitbay was one of the most important Mamluks of the Burji Dynasty who dominated
            Egypt for more than 150 years. Al-Ashraf Qaitbay ruled for more than 25 years, between 1468 and 1496, and
            was considered one of the most important builders of that period.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Some of the monuments that are still preserved are the madrasa (school) and the funerary
            temple in Cairo, its mosque in Fayoum, among others. No one could have imagined at that time, that the
            Qaitbay Citadel would one day become one of the most visited tourist sites by tourists on vacation in Egypt.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">The important rule of Qitbay Citadel throughout the ages</h2>
        <p class="article-text">During the rule of the Ottomans, the citadel was considered a very important stronghold
            to protect the northern coasts of Egypt.At that time, ranks and categories were added for the soldiers,
            dividing them into infantry, cavalry, and artillery.When the French invaded Egypt in 1798, they took control
            of the citadel as a starting point to dominate the country.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Mohamed Ali, the builder of modern Egypt, recognized the importance of the citadel when
            he became the ruler of the country. He restored the walls and added cannons to preserve this strategic point
            of Egypt. After the Revolution of Ahmed Orabi, the city of Alexandria was exposed to bombing by the British
            Navy and this produced some cracks in the walls that remained so for 25 years.In 1904, the Committee for the
            Preservation of Islamic Monuments carried out several renovations, based on studies conducted by French
            scientists and academics during the occupation of Egypt.Today, the Citadel of Qaitbay has become one of the
            most popular historical sites in Egypt and one of the most visited by travelers on tours in Alexandria.</p>
